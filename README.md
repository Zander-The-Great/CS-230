-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room company would like to develop a web-based game that can run on multiple platforms. The game will be called “Draw It or Lose It”.

The purpose of this game is multiple teams consisting of several people going four rounds for a minute each. A picture will be pulled from a library of images. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit. 


-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Laying out all the necessary information that the client would need so they can make the decisions needed to move forward with the development.

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

To me laying out all the clients needs is like designing a map. Once we have the map and know our destination it makes it much easier to get to the end result.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One thing that we did not address is the actual "System Architechture View". It was not really needed in our documentation. But if I were the client I would want more information on that. Once we know the budget and the demands we can then figure out whats needed for the physical or even virtual architechture. If we were to add anything in addition to this It would be an improvement.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user gave us the general picture that they wanted to come to fruition. Once we had this general Idea by using our knowledge we learned so far we can impliment things such as: a Summary of whats needed, which gives us an idea of what possible constraints there are, in conjunction with budgets/demands we can setup the architechture and Domain model(UML)for the app development, which leads to an over all evaluation. 

When designing software we need to consider the users needs. At the end of the day the application needs to be efficient and user friendly. If it is not it would defeat the purpose of the app. Applications are designed for the end users at the end of the day for it is them who are using it!

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The approach I like to take is a calculated one. By listening to the clients and end users feedback we can begin Planning from the bottom up. Everything from Hardware and software requirements and what is the big picture. Start with the relavant idea and then build from there. In the begining of the class I struggled with UML diagrams but by the end I see they can be a very powerful tool to illistrate the inner workings that are needed. This would be one of my new tools I would use for future development.
